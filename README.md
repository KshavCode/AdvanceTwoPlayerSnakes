# Adv. Two Player Snake Game 🐍🎮
A snake which is built in Python. The soundtracks and sprites, are all created by me. This is the advanced version of the previous version of snake game. This version has all the elements correctly placed and it's without any bugs (i hope so). You can play 1 player, which is usual snake game and 2 player, which is based on slither.io idea. Thanks and enjoy!
